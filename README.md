## Overview

### The challenge

- Visualize the component properly.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

In this project we learn how to use React to make components.

```css
.payment{
    width: 85%;
    border: none;
    background-color: var(--brightBlue);
    color: var(--veryPaleBlue);
    border-radius: 7px;
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 10px var(--desaturatedBlue);
    font-weight: 900;
    height: 40px;
}
```


### Continued development

We need to continue learning about how React works.

### Useful resources
